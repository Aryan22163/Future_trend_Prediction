# ₿ Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM (Deep Learning)

This project predicts future Bitcoin (BTC) prices using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** — a deep learning model specialized in time series forecasting. The model learns patterns in historical BTC data to make future price predictions.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes historical Bitcoin prices with key columns:
- `Date`
- `Open`
- `High`
- `Low`
- `Close`
- `Volume`

> The `Close` price is used as the target variable for forecasting.
